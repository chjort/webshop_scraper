Do not charge regular Duracell batteries (only batteries marked Rechargeable). Please avoid mixing used with new batteries, or batteries of different brands. When replacing batteries in a device, replace them all because different levels of discharge & voltage could lead to venting / leakage. Fully used batteries should be immediately removed from devices and disposed of properly (as pertained by local laws). When discharged batteries are kept in your device for a long time, leakage may occur causing damage to the device. Avoid deforming or dismantling batteries in any way. Batteries contain various active ingredients which store electrochemical energy and can be dangerous if they contact your skin. Store unused batteries in their original packaging and away from metal objects. Mixing batteries with metal objects can cause the battery to short circuit and affect the battery performance. Do not throw away. Please follow local requirements to recycle electronic appliances and batteries.
